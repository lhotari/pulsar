## Pulsar Runtime Java Version Recommendation

> **Note**:
>
> When using Java versions, it is recommended to
> use [a recent version of a particular Java release (17 or 21)](https://adoptium.net/en-GB/temurin/releases?version=21&os=linux&arch=any)
> with the most recent bug fixes and security patches.
> For example, the JVM bug [JDK-8351933](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8351933) can cause stability issues in
> Pulsar.
> [JDK-8351933](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8351933) was fixed in Java 17.0.17+ and Java 21.0.8+.
> Pulsar Docker images come with the most recent Java version at the time of release.

When using the Pulsar Java client, it is recommended to [set specific system properties and JVM options](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/next/client-libraries-java-setup/#java-client-performance) to allow optimal performance.

- zip

There is also a guide for [setting up the tooling for building Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/contribute/setup-buildtools/).

> **Note**:
>
> This project includes a [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/) that can be used instead of a system-installed Maven.
> Use it by replacing `mvn` by `./mvnw` on Linux and `mvnw.cmd` on Windows in the commands below.    

### Build

Compile and install:

```bash
$ mvn install -DskipTests
```

Compile and install individual module

```bash
$ mvn -pl module-name (e.g: pulsar-broker) install -DskipTests
```

### Minimal build (This skips most of external connectors and tiered storage handlers)

```bash
mvn install -Pcore-modules,-main -DskipTests
```

Run Unit Tests:

```bash
$ mvn test
```

Run Individual Unit Test:

```bash
$ mvn -pl module-name (e.g: pulsar-client) test -Dtest=unit-test-name (e.g: ConsumerBuilderImplTest)
```

Run Selected Test packages:

```bash
$ mvn test -pl module-name (for example, pulsar-broker) -Dinclude=org/apache/pulsar/**/*.java
```

Start standalone Pulsar service:

```bash
$ bin/pulsar standalone
```

Check https://pulsar.apache.org for documentation and examples.

## Build custom docker images

The commands used in the Apache Pulsar release process can be found in the [release process documentation](https://pulsar.apache.org/contribute/release-process/#stage-docker-images).

Here are some general instructions for building custom docker images:

* Docker images must be built with Java 8 for `branch-2.7` or previous branches because of [ISSUE-8445](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/8445).
* Java 11 is the recommended JDK version in `branch-2.8`, `branch-2.9` and `branch-2.10`.
* Java 17 is the recommended JDK version in `branch-2.11`, `branch-3.0` and `branch-3.3`.
* Java 21 is the recommended JDK version since `branch-4.0`.

The following command builds the docker images `apachepulsar/pulsar-all:latest` and `apachepulsar/pulsar:latest`:

```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests
# setting DOCKER_CLI_EXPERIMENTAL=enabled is required in some environments with older docker versions
export DOCKER_CLI_EXPERIMENTAL=enabled
mvn package -Pdocker,-main -am -pl docker/pulsar-all -DskipTests
```

After the images are built, they can be tagged and pushed to your custom repository. Here's an example of a bash script that tags the docker images with the current version and git revision and pushes them to `localhost:32000/apachepulsar`.

```bash
image_repo_and_project=localhost:32000/apachepulsar
pulsar_version=$(mvn initialize help:evaluate -Dexpression=project.version -pl . -q -DforceStdout)
gitrev=$(git rev-parse HEAD | colrm 10)
tag="${pulsar_version}-${gitrev}"
echo "Using tag $tag"
docker tag apachepulsar/pulsar-all:latest ${image_repo_and_project}/pulsar-all:$tag
docker push ${image_repo_and_project}/pulsar-all:$tag
docker tag apachepulsar/pulsar:latest ${image_repo_and_project}/pulsar:$tag
docker push ${image_repo_and_project}/pulsar:$tag
```
